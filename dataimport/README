#Landsat Search and Download
The following library provides to for conducting search and downloading of NASA Landsat 8 data vis the AWS api. Substantial code is sourced from the landsat-util library.


##The Search Library
The following functions are defined for the `search` class:

	class Search:

The function `search` is the main user facing function: 

	Search.search(paths_rows=None, lat=None, lon=None, address=None, end_date=None, cloud_min=None, cloud_max=None, limit=1, geojson=False)

- `paths_rows=None` is a string in the format: `'003,003,004,004'` which gives a landsat path/row reference.
- `lat=None` is a string, float, or integer denoting a latitude.
- `lon=None` is a string, float, or integer denoting a longitude.
- `address=None` is a string denoting an address.
- `start_date=None` is a date string in format YYY-MM-DD denoting a start date.
- `end_date=None`  is a date string in format YYY-MM-DD denoting an end date.
- `cloud_min` is a float denoting the minimal cloud coverage.
- `cloud_max` is a float denoting the maximal cloud coverage.
- `limit` is an integer which gives the maximum number of search results returned.
- `geojson`* is a boolean value denoting whether a geojson object would be returned 

The function returns a dictionary that looks like the following:

	{
	    'status': u'SUCCESS',
	    'total_returned': 1,
	    'total': 1,
	    'limit': 1
	    'results': [
	        {
	            'sat_type': u'L8',
	            'sceneID': u'LC80030032014142LGN00',
	            'date': u'2014-05-22',
	            'path': u'003',
	            'thumbnail': u'http://....../landsat_8/2014/003/003/LC80030032014142LGN00.jpg',
	            'cloud': 33.36,
	            'row': u'003
	        }
	    ]
    }

##The Download Library
The following functions are defined for the `download` class:

	class Download(object):

The function `download` is the main funcion for this class:

	Download.download(scenes, bands=None)

- `scenes` is a string denoting a scene IDs
- `bands=None` is a list of bands to be downloaded for the given scene

The function downloads the file requested and returns a tuple consisting of the scene id successfully downloaded paired with the source they were downloaded from (amazon or google).
